# Welcome to silox-bassoon!

## This repository contains the data and model for calculating the temperature dependence of the organic carbon water partioning coefficient (Koc)
## of volatile methylsiloxanes (VMS). The modeling and experimental approaches are discussed in this publication: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.7b00138
